# GitHub LinkedIn Post - Observability Demo App

## LinkedIn Post for GitHub Sharing (Under 3,000 characters)

🚀 **Open-sourced my Observability Demo Application on GitHub!**

After building this comprehensive project, I'm excited to share it with the developer community. This is a complete reference implementation for modern observability practices.

🔗 **GitHub Repository:** [Add your GitHub link here]

**📦 What you'll find:**
✅ Production-ready Spring Boot application
✅ Complete observability stack (Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Prometheus)
✅ CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, SonarQube & Trivy
✅ Docker containerization with security best practices
✅ Grafana Cloud integration for production monitoring
✅ Pre-configured dashboards and alerting

**🎯 Perfect for:**
• Developers learning application monitoring
• DevOps engineers implementing observability
• Students studying modern CI/CD practices
• Teams wanting a complete reference implementation

**📚 Key Learning Areas:**
• Custom metrics with Micrometer & Prometheus
• Structured logging with correlation IDs
• Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
• Automated security scanning & quality gates
• Local development with Docker Compose
• Production monitoring with Grafana Cloud

**💡 Why I'm sharing this:**
Too many projects treat observability as an afterthought. This demo shows how to build monitoring, logging, and tracing into your application from day one.

The repo includes detailed documentation, step-by-step setup guides, and best practices I've learned from production systems.

**🙏 How you can help:**
⭐ Star the repo if you find it useful
🍴 Fork it for your own projects
🐛 Report issues or suggest improvements
💬 Share your observability experiences
